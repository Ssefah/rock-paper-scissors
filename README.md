# Odin's JavaScript Project

This a rock, paper and scissors classic game implemented in javascript as an exercise in the Odin's Prooject (TOP)

### First Part
---
It's first part has no user interface (UI),as it is focused on developing the intial logic of the program

### Second Part 
---
The second part kinda continues from the first part but with a few changes and hoping to develop a beautiful and interactive UI for any one interesred to play someday.
